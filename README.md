# OSP-SAP: Optimal Sensor Placement for SAP2000

**OSP-SAP** is a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed for **Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP)** in **SAP2000** finite element models. The software integrates four optimization algorithms to determine the best sensor locations for **Operational Modal Analysis (OMA)**, ensuring efficient structural monitoring.

## üöÄ Features
- Intuitive **MATLAB AppDesigner** GUI.
- Direct integration with **SAP2000** FEM models.
- Implementation of four OSP algorithms:
  - **Effective Independence (EfI)**
  - **Mass Weighted Effective Independence (EfIwm)**
  - **Strain Energy Matrix Rank Optimization (SEMRO)**
  - **Kinetic Energy Matrix Rank Optimization (KEMRO)**
- Interactive visualization of results.
- Export sensor layouts as **AutoCAD (.dxf)** files and **Word (.docx)** reports.
- Open-source and customizable for further research.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. Ensure you have **MATLAB** installed.
2. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/asanchezlc/OSP-SAP).
3. The GUI can be **directly run** by executing the following file:  
   **`Run_Interface.m`**  

   Alternatively, if you prefer, you can **install the app** as described below:
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the downloaded `OSP_SAP.mlappinstall` file.
   - **Double-click** the file, or use the following command in MATLAB:
     ```matlab
     matlab.apputil.install('OSP_SAP.mlappinstall')
     ```
   - **Launch the app** from the **App Manager** in MATLAB.

## üìñ Getting Started: Video Tutorial

**OSP-SAP** comes with a guided tutorial to help you quickly set up and use the software. If you‚Äôre new to OSP-SAP, we recommend watching this **step-by-step video guide** before proceeding with manual usage.
