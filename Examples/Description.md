# Examples Folder - Description of Provided Files

This folder contains all the files necessary to reproduce the illustrative examples presented in the manuscript. Below is a detailed description of the available contents.

## Examples/Case_Study_I: Beam Example
- **example_beam.sdb**: Original SAP2000 model file of the beam.
- **example_beam.xlsx**: SAP2000 model exported as an Excel file, used as input in OSP-SAP.
- **example_beam.mat**: MATLAB data file generated after importing *example_beam.xlsx* and running the modal analysis.
- **example_beam_results.mat**: MATLAB data file generated after running the OSP algorithm, containing the resulting sensor placements.
- **example_beam_CAD.dxf**: AutoCAD drawing of the beam with sensor placements generated by OSP-SAP after executing the OSP algorithm.
- **example_beam_report.docx**: Word report generated by OSP-SAP summarizing the OSP results.

## Examples/Case_Study_II: Building Example
- **example_building.sdb**: Original SAP2000 model file of the building.
- **example_building.xlsx**: SAP2000 model exported as an Excel file, used as input in OSP-SAP.
- **example_building.mat**: MATLAB data file generated after importing *example_building.xlsx* and performing modal analysis.
- **example_building_refs.sdb**: SAP2000 model generated by OSP-SAP after defining reference sensors based on G-OSP results; it constitutes the starting point of the M-OSP problem.
- **example_building_refs.xlsx**: Excel export of the updated SAP2000 model with reference sensors, used for the M-OSP procedure.
- **example_building_with_refs.mat**: MATLAB data file generated after importing *example_building_refs.xlsx* and performing modal analysis.
- **example_building_with_refs_results.mat**: MATLAB data file containing M-OSP results obtained after executing the algorithm.
- **example_building_CAD.dxf**: AutoCAD drawing showing sensor placements after running the M-OSP algorithm.
- **example_building_report.docx**: Word report generated by OSP-SAP summarizing the M-OSP results.
